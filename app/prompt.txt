Issue2 : The api interface design is not correct :
Your application exposes an API endpoint. You may host it anywhere. Let’s assume it’s at https://app.example.com/api/.

The endpoint must accept a POST request, e.g. POST https://app.example.com/api/ with a data analysis task description and optional attachments in the body. For example:

curl "https://app.example.com/api/" -F "questions.txt=@question.txt" -F "image.png=@image.png" -F "data.csv=@data.csv"

== Important Instructions ==
* While running in Agent mode, do not run commands directly on this machine. The actual Python code and API server run inside a Docker container. All tests and commands should either be executed using `curl` or from within the Docker container.

* The application is installed and executed inside Docker. Ensure that all interactions, including testing and API calls, are containerized.

* No need to create test scripts unless specifically mentioned in the context.

* No need to create additional instruction markdown files unless explicitly requested.

* These are not the final questions for evaluation. The examples provided are indicative. Ensure that data scraping and prompts are generic and adaptable to any table or use case.

* Code linter used: `flake8`. Before running `flake8`, activate the virtual environment (`venv`).

* To run the linter, you can also use the `fix_lint.sh` script after modifying it appropriately.

* To start the application:
  - Use `docker-compose up -d` to start the container.
  - Use `docker-compose down` to stop the container.

* To check logs:
  - Use `docker logs llm_orchestrator`.

* To update the code:
  - Pull the latest changes using `git pull origin main`.
  - Restart the container using `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`.

* Health check endpoint:
  - Use `curl http://localhost:8080/health` to verify the application's health status.

* Ensure that `.env` is properly configured with all required API keys and environment variables before starting the application.
