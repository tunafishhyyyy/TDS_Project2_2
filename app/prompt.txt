#Issue1 : Wikipedia example is not working Here is the current output for the wikipedia example  :
["Number of $2bn movies released before 2000: None","{'status': 'success', 'data': [], 'metadata': {'original_rows': 50, 'filtered_rows': 0, 'filters_applied': {'Worldwide gross': '>=2000000000', 'Year': '<2000'}}}","Correlation between Rank and Peak: None","Scatterplot: None"]

whereas it should have answered the four questions.
1. How many $2 bn movies were released before 2000?
2. Which is the earliest film that grossed over $1.5 bn?
3. What's the correlation between the Rank and Peak?
4. Draw a scatterplot of Rank and Peak along with a dotted red regression line through it.

full server logs are present in logs/app.log

Issue2 : The api interface design is not correct :
Your application exposes an API endpoint. You may host it anywhere. Letâ€™s assume itâ€™s at https://app.example.com/api/.

The endpoint must accept a POST request, e.g. POST https://app.example.com/api/ with a data analysis task description and optional attachments in the body. For example:

curl "https://app.example.com/api/" -F "questions.txt=@question.txt" -F "image.png=@image.png" -F "data.csv=@data.csv"


== Important Instructions ==

* The application is NOT installed inside Docker currently to speed up develoment. So run direct command or hot reload should be sufficient Ensure venv is activated.
* No need to create test scripts unless specifically mentioned in the context.

* No need to create additional instruction markdown files unless explicitly requested.

* These are not the final questions for evaluation. The examples provided are indicative. Ensure that data scraping and prompts are generic and adaptable to any table or use case.

* Code linter used: `flake8`. Before running `flake8`, activate the virtual environment (`venv`).

* To run the linter, you can also use the `fix_lint.sh` script after modifying it appropriately.

* Health check endpoint:
  - Use `curl http://localhost:8080/health` to verify the application's health status.

* Ensure that `.env` is properly configured with all required API keys and environment variables before starting the application.
