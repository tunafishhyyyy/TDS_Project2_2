== Important Instructions ==

* The application is NOT installed inside Docker currently to speed up develoment. So run direct command or hot reload should be sufficient Ensure venv is activated.
* No need to create test scripts unless specifically mentioned in the context.

* No need to create additional instruction markdown files unless explicitly requested.

* These are not the final questions for evaluation. The examples provided are indicative. Ensure that data scraping and prompts are generic and adaptable to any table or use case.

* Code linter used: `flake8`. Before running `flake8`, activate the virtual environment (`venv`).

* To run the linter, you can also use the `fix_lint.sh` script after modifying it appropriately.

* Health check endpoint:
  - Use `curl http://localhost:8080/health` to verify the application's health status.

* Ensure that `.env` is properly configured with all required API keys and environment variables before starting the application.
