The output only included a count of total judgments (count_star(): 15901854) and a generic explanation of how to answer the questions, not the actual answers.
The LLM response stated that the answers are "not directly available from the provided data" and described the process, but did not compute or return the specific results for:
Which high court disposed the most cases from 2019â€“2022
The regression slope for delay in court=33_10
The actual plot as a meaningful base64 image (the image string is just a placeholder)
Reason:
The fallback DuckDB query did not provide the grouped, regression, or plot data needed for the LLM to answer directly. Only a count and a sample row were available.

To get correct answers:
The DuckDB step must run the actual analysis queries (group by, regression, etc.) and pass those results to the LLM/analyze step.

Let me know if you want to update the fallback logic to generate and run these specific queries automatically.

What works:

DuckDB is used for querying the Parquet dataset.
The fallback plan does not use fetch_web for this structured data.
What needs improvement:

The DuckDB query in the fallback is too generic (SELECT * FROM data LIMIT 10 or just a count).
The LLM needs to be given the actual results of grouped counts, regression, and delay calculations, not just a sample or count.
Next steps:

Improve the fallback DuckDB query to:
Group by court and count for 2019-2022.
Calculate delay and regression for court=33_10.
Return results that the LLM can use to answer the questions directly.
Optionally, add logic to extract and run relevant SQL queries from the user question if present.
Would you like me to update the fallback logic to generate more specific DuckDB queries for these common analysis patterns, so the LLM receives the right data to answer?



== Important Instructions ==

* The application is NOT installed inside Docker currently to speed up develoment. So run direct command or hot reload should be sufficient Ensure venv is activated.
* No need to create test scripts unless specifically mentioned in the context.

* No need to create additional instruction markdown files unless explicitly requested.

* These are not the final questions for evaluation. The examples provided are indicative. Ensure that data scraping and prompts are generic and adaptable to any table or use case.

* Code linter used: `flake8`. Before running `flake8`, activate the virtual environment (`venv`).

* To run the linter, you can also use the `fix_lint.sh` script after modifying it appropriately.

* Health check endpoint:
  - Use `curl http://localhost:8080/health` to verify the application's health status.

* Ensure that `.env` is properly configured with all required API keys and environment variables before starting the application.
